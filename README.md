Novation Circuit hacks

## Todo
-v Use number instead of name in for synth in parameters (default control synth), and one array that maps number to name
-v use mappings when updating midi mapper table
-v support drum panning, channel
- settings guio hookup
- style buttons
- test with 2 circuits
- remove use of macroControls
- don't pan to extremes, because Circuit bugs out and includes some in the other ear as well
- pass mappings as parameter to functions
- optimize receiveMIDIMessage
